## Executive Summary
This report presents the findings from our statistical analysis of the AlphaCare Insurance dataset. We implemented multiple machine learning models to predict insurance claims and analyzed feature importance to understand key factors affecting claim amounts.

### Key Findings:
- Successfully processed and analyzed insurance data with over 1 million records
- Implemented both linear and non-linear regression models
- Identified key features influencing insurance claims
- Achieved significant predictive accuracy in claim amount estimation
