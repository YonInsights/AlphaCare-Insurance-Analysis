# AlphaCare Insurance Analysis

## **Overview**
Welcome to the AlphaCare Insurance Analysis project! This repository demonstrates my skills as a Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer by tackling real-world business problems in the insurance industry. The goal of this project is to analyze historical car insurance claim data to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk customer segments for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) in South Africa.

## **Business Objective**
AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) is committed to developing cutting-edge risk and predictive analytics for car insurance planning and marketing. This project focuses on analyzing historical insurance data to:
- Optimize marketing strategies.
- Identify low-risk targets for premium reduction.
- Build predictive models to inform decision-making.

## **Tasks and Deliverables**

### **Git and GitHub Setup**
- **Create a GitHub repository**: Ensure version control and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- **Branching Strategy**: Includes a dedicated `task-1` branch for EDA and statistical analysis.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data summarization: Descriptive statistics for features like `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`.
- Data quality assessment: Identify missing values and ensure proper data formatting.
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis: Distribution of variables, correlations, and geographic trends.
- Outlier Detection: Leverage box plots to detect anomalies in the data.
- Creative Visualizations: Highlight insights using creative and impactful plots.

### **Statistical Analysis**
- Employ statistical distributions to provide evidence for actionable insights derived from the data.

### **Machine Learning**
- Develop predictive models to estimate optimal premiums.
- Analyze feature importance for customer segmentation and risk assessment.

## **Key Features of the Repository**
1. **Modular Codebase**: Organized folder structure for easy navigation and maintenance.
2. **Version Control**: Ensure transparency and reproducibility using Git.
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive and beginner-friendly README and code comments.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.

## **Tools and Technologies**
